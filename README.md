🚀 Port Scanner Application 🔍
📋 Overview
This project is a port scanning application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It efficiently scans open ports on target systems, combining solid software design with practical cybersecurity functionality. 🔐

✨ Features
Built with robust OOP concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction 🧩
Scans and identifies open ports on a given IP address or hostname 🌐
Modular and scalable architecture for easy enhancements ⚙️
Practical tool for network security analysis and ethical hacking 🛡️
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Core Java(OOP) only(Socket for Scanning)💻
OOP principles applied throughout the codebase 📚
Networking libraries for port scanning functionality 🌍
🚀 Usage
Clone the repository: bash git clone https://github.com/pavankumar559-cp/OOP_with_Hacking.git
Navigate to the project directory: bash cd port-scanner
Run the application: bash [Provide the command to run your app, e.g., python scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1]
Follow the on-screen instructions to scan the desired ports. 🎯
